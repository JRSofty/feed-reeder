<p>At first, I considered having various people wield the wand.</p><p>Then I was like "nah, this whole idea of this party was for Ashley, let her go on a shrink rampage."</p><p>I mean, a rampage in which she asks for volunteers and permission and such, but still.</p><p>Rampage.</p><p>And as much as I'd rather let the page speak for itself, I know some would appreciate the following, so...</p><p>Panel one - Ashley is chosen as wand user, ask swho wants to be shrunk. Diane nervously volunteers.</p><p>Panel two - SHRRRRIIIIINK!</p><p>Panel three - Ashley offers to shrink Nanase. Nanase notices Ashley seems slightly nervous about asking, and will never admit to being happy about it.</p><p>Panel four - Susan's back from changing, and WHOA! Tiny Justin!</p><p>Panel five - "Ha ha you're short"</p><p>Panel six - CAAAAAAAAKE!</p><p><b>Cake</b></p><p>I definitely cheated the apparent size of that piece of cake in the last panel. Like, the cake slices are definitely huge relative to normal cake slices, but cake slices aren't actually that big to begin with. Of course, they can look huge from a first person perspective, looking down at your plate, but then look at someone else holding a plate with their slice. Look how tiny that is relative to them!</p><p>Well, except for Steve's. Way to take half the cake, Steve.</p><p>Anyway, I wanted it to look huge, so... Trick of perspective. They're a little further away from that piece than one might initially assume.</p><p>But rest assured! It looks positively huge to them.</p><p>--</p><p><a href="https://www.egscomics.com//egsnp/wao1-006">- Saturday EGSNP</a></p><p><a href="https://www.egscomics.com//egsnp/wao1-007">- Tuesday EGSNP</a></p>

<p>This is a difficult choice for Diane, but I can't imagine anyone passing up the chance to have a slice of cake that appears eight times as big while having the exact same calories as a normal-sized slice.</p><p>The tiny forks Grace mentions are likely the sort used when eating crab (and maybe other foods, but that's MY frame of reference, thank you very much), and there are a lot of potential options for relatively tiny glasses.</p><p>This page was posted absurdly late for a few reasons. The first was simply that I was behind schedule to begin with, and a second was because of a bit of writer's block when it came for an activity that could involve more magic, but also be chill, fun, and make sense for the party.</p><p>If this answer of "omg relatively giant cake being suggested by Grace specifically" seems obvious, many things do in retrospect.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p><p>Since we're nearing a point of genuinely wrapping up this storyline, and since I'd said "Friday comic Friday! For reals!", I decided to share this page once it was done, and push the next one to next Wednesday. This gives me a chance to eliminate writing last minute as factor, and potentially actually have the comic done before, y'know, the day before.</p><p>Once this story arc is over, which is still several pages away, I intend to take at least a couple weeks off from story comics. I'll decide when we get there how much time seems sensible. I actually have some of the next storyline written, which is unusual, but it happens sometime.</p><p>--</p><p><a href="https://www.egscomics.com//egsnp/wao1-005">- Thursday EGSNP</a></p>

<p>Fun fact: This was originally just supposed to be Nanase awkwardly apologizing for not killing the vampire, and Susan pointing out that neither of them should have been there. It was going to be pretty chill and done in three panels.</p><p>Then I thought "hang on, I haven't really checked in depth on Nanase's feelings on this subject. I probably don't need to, she was actually pretty on board with taking out the vampire, but best to do that before finishing this comic for Friday, which is about two thirds inked already."</p><p>"Let's see, and HOLY HECK SHE'S CRYING SHE'S CRYING SO MUCH OH YE GODS SHE FEELS TERRIBLE I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING"</p><p>So that happened, which naturally impacts other things, too, like panel eight. What's Tedd doing there, all focused on while Nanase's talking about protecting Susan? What's going on in that Tedd head?!</p><p>Anyway, I am glad I caught that in time, though it's a LITTLE embarrassing that I wasn't kidding about having two thirds of the previous comic inked before realizing how Nanase felt about all this and having to do a rewrite right then and there.&Acirc;&nbsp;</p><p>--</p><p><a href="https://www.egscomics.com//egsnp/wao1-003">- Saturday EGSNP</a></p>

I was exhausted, upset about current events, and I wasn't sure I even wanted to share this page right away if it was going to be this page at the end of that week.</p><p>I'd apologize for being a bit of a downer, but this is the commentary for a page in which Tedd tries to retreat into analysis as a coping mechanism for emotional shock.
